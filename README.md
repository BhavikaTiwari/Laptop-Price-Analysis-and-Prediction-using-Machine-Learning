üíª Laptop Sales Price Prediction
üìå Overview

This project focuses on predicting the price of laptops based on their specifications such as company, CPU, GPU, RAM, operating system, and other technical details.
The workflow includes data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning model building to accurately estimate laptop prices.

‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values.

Converted categorical columns using OneHotEncoding.

Normalized and transformed numerical features for better predictions.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized distributions of price with respect to features.

Observed trends between RAM, CPU, and brand on pricing.

Feature Engineering

Extracted useful information from complex columns (e.g., screen resolution, CPU brand, GPU type).

Encoded categorical variables.

Model Building

üìà Results

The model successfully captured the relationship between laptop specifications and prices.

Features like RAM, Company, and CPU brand were the most influential in predicting laptop prices.

The regression model provided a reasonable prediction accuracy, making it a good baseline.

‚úÖ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied in the consumer electronics market to predict product prices based on specifications.
By analyzing the dataset, we learned that:

RAM size, brand reputation, and CPU/GPU quality have a significant impact on laptop pricing.

The model can assist retailers, e-commerce platforms, and customers in understanding fair pricing trends.
